`*` Read the Plugin/theme/block author's [documentation](https://github.com/imath/entrepot/wiki) for more information. By registering a plugin, a theme or a block, I'm agreeing with the [code of conduct](https://github.com/imath/entrepot/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

<!-- If you wish to register your repository into the Entrepôt : -->

<!-- 1. Make sure to publish GitHub releases including a Zip Archive of your repository into its download section (using your plugin/theme/block's slug to name this Zip Archive). -->
<!-- 2. Make sure to always be up to date with latest WordPress release. -->
<!-- 3. Make sure your plugin/theme/block's slug is unique : there cannot be duplicates which means you cannot register to the Entrepôt if your plugin, theme or block is hosted on [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). -->
<!-- 4. Your plugin, theme or block must be **GPL** compatible, **free to use** with **no ads nowhere into its source code**. -->
